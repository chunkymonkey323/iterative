      <h1>What is yhangry?</h1>
      <h2>Yhangry is a private chef marketplace, where you can book a chef whenever you want to socialise at home.

        For $40pp, you can book a 3-course feast in just a few clicks. On the supply side, we help chefs earn 3 times as much as working in a restaurant.
      </h2>
      <h2>The interface we decided to design was a mobile app. The users who would be impacted by our interface are adults looking to book a chef. Assuming that these users
      are familiar with other food delivery apps, this app should be reminiscent of that for them. </h2>

          Upon discussing, we decided to start our home page with a button called "Book a Chef" that would take one to the Chef Selection page.
          Upon reaching this page, it would prompt one to fill out a filter criteria, then the appropriate chefs would appear. From there,
          we combined sketch ideas to formulate how the chef selection process would work. Additionally, we created a bookings page that would
          help keep track of what had been done. Lastly, we added a nav bar that would help users navigate quickly from the home page, chef selection page,
          and bookings page.

        <h2>After getting feedback, we implemented all feedback that we got during studio.
          We made a more realistic top bar which wasn't obstructed by the phone view, made chef pages
          more prominent, made the entirety of the card clickable, and separated account info and setting.
          We also added pages to make sure every button and page was functional and set up including the
          filter and book page. We also made the homepage more returning-user friendly by removing the
          "what is yhangry?" page.

        <h1>User Analysis</h1>
        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <h3>We assigned our users to book a chef who specializes in Mexican cuisine and who has more than 4 stars as their rating. Our expectation was for the user to use our filter button to get the appropriate chef. Two out of three participants used the filter button whereas one did not.
          Upon entering the home page, most users knew they had to click the Find a Chef button but still browsed around to see what other things the home page had to offer. One interesting thing we noticed was that the  user tried clicking on the upcoming order which was not supposed to be clickable. Upon clicking the Find a Chef button, they were redirected to a Chef Selection page where a range of chefs were available to click on. An error that we discovered was that one of the chefs available already specialized in Mexican cuisine and was rated 4 or more stars. This made one user skip the filter button. Most users clicked on the filter button and applied the appropriate criteria. We discovered that the filter was not exactly accurate and had English/French as their cuisine specialty even though when you click on the chef, the specialty comes up as Mexican. This did not impact their ability to successfully complete the task. From there, all users were able to click on the chef and book.

          One user liked the filter and thought it was really easy. They also liked the rating on the profile page and suggested adding a review page or section for a chef.
          Another user said it was a very simple app yet they were confused about what upcoming orders were referring to. They suggested making it more colorful and interesting.

          In response to the user testing, we would like to change the color scheme, distinguish between clickable and non-clickable items, and possibly add a review section.
